A simple project that demonstrates my learning path to discover basic Sort algorithms.





## Description

This is a simple app that demonstrates the use of two sorting algorithms 
Random Sort and Merge Sort.


Random sort is a sorting algorithm that randomly shuffles the input array until it becomes sorted. The algorithm works by repeatedly shuffling the array until it is sorted. While this algorithm may not be efficient for large arrays, it can be useful in certain scenarios where a random order is desired.


Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sorting an array. The algorithm works by recursively dividing the array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains only one element. The subarrays are then merged back together in sorted order to produce the final sorted array. Merge sort is known for its efficiency and is often used as a standard algorithm for sorting large datasets.
